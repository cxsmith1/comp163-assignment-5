Caleb Smith Assignment 5 | COMP 163

For challenge one, I created an empty list that appended a number each time the loop was run whether it was divisible by 2 or not. 
Each time the loop was run the empty variable step had one added. 
While n is greater than one, if divisible by two, cut it in half until n is one. For each halving add one to step, and add each half to the sequence list.
If not divisible by two, multiply by three and add one, add this new result to the sequence list as well. Then follow the same logic as above.
I used AI for the intermediate variable, as I was always a few short in the steps due to it not counting it as a step, I was a little confused but it makes sense now..

For challenge two, I set the variable primefr to true unless proven otherwise. Then, I created a range of 2 to one less than the number input.
If the number input is divisible at all, it outputs that it is not prime.
Otherwise (else) it shows that it is prime.
No AI used.

For challenge 3, I created three empty variables, and assigned my rows and column to range 1-10.
I then added a space to the top left corner, making our table a bit less jumbled.
Then, we print the rows and headers, and multiply each number using our third empty variable, creating our grid.
Using if statements allows me to keep it pretty simple, as all of our variables are equal to zero since they're empty, and they'll print 1-10.
I used AI for the spacing, everything was jumbled up and super close when I first tried it out, and it makes more sense now.
